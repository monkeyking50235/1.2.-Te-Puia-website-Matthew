        <h2>
            Te Puia has many interesting places to explore, with a geothermal
            valley and two national schools, one of which teaches weaving, and 
            the other teaches carving.
        </h2>

        <h3>
            Two prominant places found in Te puia are the weaving and 
            carving schools, which are national schools of Aotearoa
            that teach treasured skills to be used for generations.
        </h3>
        <p>
            At the National Weaving school, students are taught the skills and 
            traditions of a craft hundreds of years old. As well as learning 
            how to weave harakeke (flax) and other materials, students learn 
            the stories and designs unique to each iwi (tribe), as well as the 
            MƒÅori protocols associated with weaving. These include planting 
            according to the phases of the moon and reciting prayers of thanks 
            for flax and trees used. Conversly, the National Carving school 
            tutors carving students for three years, under the guidance of 
            those, such as Clive Fugill and James Rickard, master carvers at 
            Te Puia who were once institute carving students themselves.
