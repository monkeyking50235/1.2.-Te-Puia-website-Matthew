               Te Puia has many interesting places to explore, with a 
               geothermal valley and two national schools, one of which 
               teaches weaving, and the other teaches carving.
            </h2>
            <h3>
               Two prominant places found in Te puia are the weaving and 
               carving schools, which are national schools of Aotearoa
               that teach treasured skills to be used for generations.
            </h3>

            <p>
               At the National Weaving school, students are taught the skills 
               and traditions of a craft hundreds of years old. As well as 
               learning how to weave harakeke (flax) and other materials, 
               students learn the stories and designs unique to each iwi 
               (tribe), as well as the MƒÅori protocols associated with 
               weaving. These include planting according to the phases of the 
               moon and reciting prayers of thanks for flax and trees used. 
               Alternatively, the National Carving school tutors carving 
               students for three years, under the guidance of those, such as 
               Clive Fugill and James Rickard, master carvers at Te Puia who 
               were once institute carving students themselves.
