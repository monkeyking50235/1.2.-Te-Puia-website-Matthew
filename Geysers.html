            <div class="text-right"><p>Te Puia's main geyser is called “Pohutu”
                 which means “Big splash” and erupts up to heights of 30 meters.
                  Pohutu is semi-predictable, as she plays 15-20 minutes after 
                  another of our active geysers. According to Maori culture, 
                  geysers are viewed as gifts from the gods<br>
                To the left of Pohutu (when viewing from the bridge) is the 
                “Prince of Wales Feathers” Geyser – named after Prince Edward 
                Albert visited here in the 1900’s. It was traditionally named 
                the “Tohu” or sign as it usually plays 10 mins before and then 
                simultaneously with Pohutu and reaches heights of up to seven 
                metres (almost 23 feet).<br>
                The “Kererū” Geyser erupts every few days from the blackened 
                crater closest to Puarenga Stream. The fan-shaped jet can reach
                 heights of up to 15 metres (just over 49 feet). It is named 
                 after the New Zealand Pigeon.<br>
                Geysers act like a giant pressure cooker on earth, shooting 
                boiling water and steam into the air. All geysers have three 
                components; an intensive heat source, a constant supply of 
                water and an underground plumbing system. As rainfall fills the 
                intricate plumbing system below the earth’s surface, molten 
                rock rapidly heats the water. The water is under significant 
                pressure causing the boiling point to be well over 125 degrees 
                Celsius. As pockets of water become turbulent, the pressure is 
                relieved by violently shooting steam and water into the air 
                with tremendous force.
