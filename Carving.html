               <p>In 1967, the first intake to the 
                  National Carving School began the task of learning the 
                  disciplines of their Māori ancestors. Among those students was 
                  Clive Fugill, the man who would become master carver of the 
                  institute today.<br>
                  “I’ll never forget that first day,” says Clive, “Our master 
                  carver, Hone Taiapa, looked at us all and said, “you are here 
                  to learn the art to pass it on to generations. Keep it alive 
                  for we could lose our identity.” It was exciting to be 
                  playing such an important role to save Māori art,” says 
                  Clive, “everyone has a reason in life. This was my reason. 
                  And that’s why I’m still here over 40 years later. If we 
                  lose our arts and crafts we lose our identity.”<br>Today 
                  fulltime carving students study for three years at the 
                  national carving school, under the guidance of those, such 
                  as Clive Fugill and James Rickard, master carvers at Te Puia 
                  who were once institute carving students themselves.<br>They 
                  learn how to carve things like the protruding tongue. The 
                  protruding tongue as used in the haka (war dance), is 
                  intended as a symbol of defiance, determination and strength, 
                  however in many carvings it can also symbolize the oral 
                  nature in which information was passed on from generation 
                  to generation, which is important to us.<br> Here at Te Puia
                   we offer you the chance to take away traditional Māori 
                   carvings; beautiful handcrafted pieces made at our National 
                   Carving School. Look for the Te Puia Official Mark of 
                   Authenticity. We also accept carving commissions.<br>

               Wooden hand clubs
            </h2>
            <p>Before Europeans and European weapons arrived in Aotearoa, 
               Māori warfare mainly involved hand-to-hand combat. 
               Warriors used many different hand weapons, including 
               taiaha (fighting staffs), pouwhenua (pointed staffs), 
               tewhatewha (axe-like staffs), tao (short spears), huata 
               (long spears) and patu (clubs). The long weapons were 
               carried, and the small clubs were often tucked into a belt. 
               Special weapons were sometimes given names and passed down 
               through generations.<br>
               Wars could be fought over land and resources, but also as 
               utu (revenge) or to increase mana (prestige). There were 
               many traditions and rules to be followed during battles in 
               earlier times. War parties (taua) could range in size from 
               a small group to a few hundred people. Most battles took 
               place in the summer months after the harvesting of crops 
               was completed. The element of surprise was important, so 
               raids often happened at dawn.<br>
               Though there were deaths and injuries as a result of s
               kirmishes in pre-European times, the numbers were very 
               small in comparison to the slaughter that occurred when 
               muskets became available.
