               <p>The mud pool is the result of acid gases and steam that cause 
                the decomposition of minerals (feldspars) to form a clay called 
                kaolin. Kaolin is white when pure, but finely divided black 
                sulphur turns it to grey.<br> The activity varies with the 
                amount of rainfall, but the temperature of the steaming bursts 
                of mud is approximately 90-95 degrees Celsius 
                (194-203 degrees Fahrenheit).<br> mud pools are also known as 
                “Frog Pools” because of the similarity between the plopping 
                mud and leaping frogs.<br> Some pools contain mud with 
                medicinal properties that are used to treat skin, rheumatic 
                and arthritic ailments. Māori traditionally used the mud to 
                treat stomach infections by mixing a small amount with water 
                and drinking it.<br>Mud pools are created in areas that have 
                limited hot water, but abundant supplies of steam and rock.<br>
                 That “pongy” smell Rotorua is famous for is due to hydrogen 
                 sulphide released by geothermal features. When released into 
                 the air, the hydrogen sulphide reacts with oxygen, creating 
                 sulphuric acid. This acid has the ability to dissolve rock 
                 into fine particles of silica and clay, and when combined 
                 with a small supply of water, a mud pool is created. The 
                 Rotorua Thermal Mud used in face masks and other beauty 
                 products is sourced from mud pools about ten times the size 
                 of Ngāmōkaiakoko Mud Pool. You can purchase some of these 
                 products from Te Puia’s Gift Shop.
